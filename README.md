Milwaukee Police Calls for Service Scraper
===========================
The Milwaukee Police Department publishes a list of dispatched calls for service on the City of Milwaukee website in an effort to provide transparent policing. However, this is done using a software product that offers no APIs. This CasperJS script changes that, scraping the list of calls and transforming it to a JSON file. Also, it provides more friendly call descriptions and formats addresses.
