Milwaukee Police Calls for Service Scraper
===========================
The Milwaukee Police Department publishes a list of dispatched calls for service on the City of Milwaukee website in an effort to provide transparent policing. However, this is done using a software product that offers no APIs for building apps based off this data. This CasperJS script changes that, scraping the current list of calls and transforming it to JSON. Also, it provides more friendly call descriptions and formats addresses.
